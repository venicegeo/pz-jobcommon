# Common Job Java API/Models

Common Java models and factories shared between the Java components. 

## Jackson Models

The models in this library are fully annotated using [Jackson ](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) in order to support serialization of the Models to and from JSON. This is used in support of the [MongoJack](https://github.com/mongojack/mongojack) library that uses Jackson to allow Models to interact directly with MongoDB.
