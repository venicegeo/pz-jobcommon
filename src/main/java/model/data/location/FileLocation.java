/**
 * Common interface for representing Resource locations. File resources
 * referenced by the Piazza system can reside in a variety of locations
 * accessible by the Piazza system; such as S3 Buckets, or internal folder
 * shares accessible to internal components, or perhaps extensible to something
 * like an FTP site.
 * 
 * This interface is used by implementations of a specific file location that
 * describe the appropriate parameters required to connect to that
 * implementation.
 * 
 * The factory class FileAccessFactory is what is intended to be used for
 * pulling the bytes out of files represented by these interfaces.
