/**
 * Basic container object a Deployment Group ID.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is a limitation of GeoServer such that Layer Groups can only be created
 * if there is at least one valid layer populated at the time of creation.
 * However, for Piazza use-cases, we want to allow users to grab a unique ID for
 * a Layer Group before they have created any actual layers. To support this
 * goal, we use this DeploymentGroup model, as persisted in Mongo, to maintain a
 * connection between a GUID delivered to a user, and a Layer Group (once
 * created) in GeoServer. The user only ever receives the GUID as held by this
 * DeploymentGroup object. In that way, we can deliver some placeholder ID to
 * the user <b>before</b> the actual Layer Group is ready to be created on
 * GeoServer.
