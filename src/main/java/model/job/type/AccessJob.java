/**
 * Describes a user Request for Accessing data out of the Piazza core system. This could potentially be for data that is
 * held within the Piazza holdings, or data that is external to Piazza core which has had its Metadata previously
 * loaded.
 * 
 * The two current deployment types are 1) Hosted on a Piazza GeoServer instance, which can allow for Web Coverage
 * Service or Web Feature Service, depending on the type of data to be accessed. 2) Raw file download. This will place
 * the file in a accessible location that the user can access, such as an FTP or an S3 location.
 * 
 * Currently, a single resource Id is provided to denote the Resource in the Piazza holdings to access.
