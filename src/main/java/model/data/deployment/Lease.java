/**
 * JSON Database Model, serialized by Jackson, that represents a Lease in the

 * 
 * A Lease represents an amount of time that a Deployed resource is available in
 * the system for. Deployments should be guaranteed to be available as long as
 * they have an active Deployment lease. A Lease is considered active as long as
 * its expiration date has not passed.
 * 
 * If the Expiration date of a lease has passed, then the resource may still be
 * available (perhaps it has not been subject to resource reaping yet) but it
 * will not be guaranteed. Periodically expired leases will be undeployed in
 * order to avoid overtaxing the system with outdated or unused deployments.
